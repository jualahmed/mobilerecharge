## Getting started

If you have never used Backpack before, the best place to understand it and get started is [backpackforlaravel.com](https://backpackforlaravel.com/). 

## Install

Please note you need to install Backpack\Base before you can use Backpack\CRUD. It will provide you with the AdminLTE design.

Installation guides:
- [Install Backpack on Laravel 5.2](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/docs/installation) - deprecated, lacks a lot of features;
- [Install Backpack on Laravel 5.3](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/docs/installation-on-laravel-53) - last feature update was 02 Feb 2017;
- [Install Backpack on Laravel 5.4](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/docs/install-on-laravel-54) - last feature update was 27 Sep 2017;
- [Install Backpack on Laravel 5.5, 5.6 or 5.7](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/3.4/introduction) - recommended;


## Features

Check out [the about page in the documentation](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/3.4/getting-started-crud-operations) to get familiar with all the Backpack\CRUD features.


## Usage

If you've already checked out the features link above, take a look at how you can create a CRUD for a model in [this example](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/3.4/getting-started-crud-operations). At the end of the page you'll also find a way you can do everything in 1-2 minutes, using the command line and [backpack/generators](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/generators).

In short:

1. Make your model use the CrudTrait.

2. Create a controller that extends CrudController.

3. Create a new resource route.

4. **(optional)** Define your validation rules in a Request files.
