# Contributors


We have been blessed with many wonderful people in our community. They help Backpack become better every day, week, month or whenever they can. It's not easy finding time to pitch in, and we're very very grateful for their support, so here's a list of them all.

> If you've pitched in on Github/StackOverflow to Backpack but aren't featured here, please submit a PR with your line and whatever you want to promote. Try to insert yourself in the same order you currently appear on the [Github contributors page](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/CRUD/graphs/contributors). Please try to fit everything into one line, using the same syntax.
